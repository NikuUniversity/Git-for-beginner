Git Submodules Guide
What are Git Submodules?
Git submodules allow you to keep a Git repository as a subdirectory of another Git repository. This lets you clone another repository into your project and keep your commits separate.
Common Use Cases

Including external libraries or dependencies
Sharing common code across multiple projects
Managing large projects with multiple components
Keeping third-party code separate from your main codebase
